# IoT Based Smart Food Monitoring System (SFMS)
SFMS is a complete solution for monitoring foods in refrigerated environments. It can be interpreted as a device to convert a basic refrigerator into a smart one. It provides support for temperature, humidity and inventory weight monitoring (requires Raspberry Pi with necessary sensors) and data logging for visualization. One of the pros is it's ability to scale up which can facilitate large scale cold storage monitoring.
### Technologies
- The system server is powered by Node.js, MongoDB
- Client side app is powered by Swift
- Sensor Module's (Raspberry Pi) monitoring daemon written in Python
- Socket Connection powered by SocketIO
